    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Welcome to NSRambling. This blog is intended to serve as a repository of notes, tips and tricks on iOS Development and other technologies.</p>

<p>Many times I find myself revisiting old projects where I came up with a certain solution for a certain problem. Trying to find that particular piece of code is often a lengthy taks so I figured it would be a nice idea to keep those in a centralized place and what better place than a blog so that I may also share these thoughts with others who might be having the same issue!</p>

<p>I also wanted to try out <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> for the first time. My previous blogging attempts were unfruitful, in part because I don&rsquo;t like Blogger or Wordpress. Doing simple tasks like getting a post up or configuring the blog itself are always a pain, plus I really enjoy using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.</p>

<p>I think my next post should be about my personal experience setting up Octopress and deploying it on GitHub!</p>

<p>Until then,</p>
