    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The blog you are reading was built using the <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> blogging framework. It runs on <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, which is a static site generator.</p>

<p>Unlike blogging platforms like Wordpress or Blogger, Octopress favors of being lightweight and fast. This means that once you have configured your environment, creating and deploying your blog is a very pleasant experience.</p>

<p>The setup process, however, is the most daunting aspect of Octopress. There&rsquo;s a reason why the platform promotes itself as &lsquo;A blogging framework for hackers&rsquo;. To get you up and running you will need to be familiar with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using of the command-line (Terminal)</li>
<li>Obtaining SSHs</li>
<li>Basic understanding of Ruby</li>
<li>Using GIT</li>
</ul>


<p>However, it&rsquo;s not so bad as it seems. Octopress&#8217; documentation will guide you through the basic <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">installation and setup</a> and its <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">deployment to GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, a pretty straight-forward task.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Welcome to NSRambling. This blog is intended to serve as a repository of notes, tips and tricks on iOS Development and other technologies.</p>

<p>Many times I find myself revisiting old projects where I came up with a certain solution for a certain problem. Trying to find that particular piece of code is often a lengthy taks so I figured it would be a nice idea to keep those in a centralized place and what better place than a blog so that I may also share these thoughts with others who might be having the same issue!</p>

<p>I also wanted to try out <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> for the first time. My previous blogging attempts were unfruitful, in part because I don&rsquo;t like Blogger or Wordpress. Doing simple tasks like getting a post up or configuring the blog itself are always a pain, plus I really enjoy using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.</p>

<p>I think my next post should be about my personal experience setting up Octopress and deploying it on GitHub!</p>

<p>Until then,</p>
