The blog you are reading was built using the [Octopress](http://octopress.org) blogging framework. It runs on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/Jekyll), which is a static site generator.

Unlike blogging platforms like Wordpress or Blogger, Octopress favors of being lightweight and fast. This means that once you have configured your environment, creating and deploying your blog is a very pleasant experience.

The setup process, however, is the most daunting aspect of Octopress. There's a reason why the platform promotes itself as 'A blogging framework for hackers'. To get you up and running you will need to be familiar with:

* Using of the command-line (Terminal)
* Obtaining SSHs
* Basic understanding of Ruby
* Using GIT

However, it's not so bad as it seems. Octopress' documentation will guide you through the basic [installation and setup](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/) and its [deployment to GitHub](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/).

All in all, a pretty straight-forward task.
